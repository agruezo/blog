# Journey from Initiate to Grand Archmage

Hey, I’m Alexander, but you can call me Alex. I'm on a journey to master AI, machine learning, and data-driven problem-solving. How far will I go? There's only one way to find out.

I hold a Master’s in Data Science and an MBA in Organizational Management: Business Analytics, giving me a unique blend of technical expertise and strategic decision-making skills. My passion lies in building AI systems, designing scalable ML pipelines, and leveraging data to drive intelligent business solutions.

After earning my degrees, I realized that formal education was just the beginning. So, I designed the following learning path in AI, ML, and data systems wizardry:

>    
>   ***Initiate*** – Learn Python, discrete math, probability, and fundamental data handling
>    
>   ***Apprentice*** – Learn linear algebra, SQL operations, and probability
>    
>   ***Acolyte*** – Learn **proof writing, **data extraction, and foundational ML models
>    
>   ***Adept*** - Master calculus, real analysis, and data manipulation
>    
>   ***Journeyman*** - Apply multivariable calculus, deep learning, and model scaling
>    
>   ***Mage*** - Master reinforcement learning, Bayesian methods, and AI product development
>    
>   ***Master Mage*** - Architect scalable AI systems, advance AI ethics, and build AI infrastructure
>    
>   ***Archmage*** - Lead AI research teams, define industry-wide AI best practices, and influence AI strategy
>    
>   ***Grand Archmage*** - Revolutionize AI through global AI strategy, governance, and innovation

When I’m not experimenting with machine learning models or fine-tuning AI systems, you’ll probably find me working out, doing Filipino martial arts, or hacking away on my laptop.

In this blog, I share what I learn — whether it’s experimenting with AI, exploring financial forecasting, or breaking down complex ML concepts. Let’s build, learn, and push forward together!
